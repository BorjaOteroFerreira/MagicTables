# MagicTables Converter

This is a small library that converts markdown tables into their HTML table counterparts.

## Why do you need this library?

In the process of formatting text in a data stream generated by a natural language model (NLM), the need arose to handle Markdown tables dynamically and efficiently. Often, extended libraries for Markdown processing do not offer direct features for table formatting. Additionally, some libraries can only format tables if they are written in specific formats with embedded variables, limiting their usefulness in more general contexts.

With MagicTables Transformer, you can easily address this need by transforming tables in the traditional Markdown format into HTML tables. This tool meets a common demand among those working with Markdown, offering a quick and simple way to convert tables for use in web pages or HTML documents, especially in data streams generated by NLMs.


## Installation
To use this library, simply include the MagicTablesConverter.js file in your project.

```html
<script src="MagicTablesConverter.js"></script>
```
## Usage

```javascript
const response = "Your response with markdown table";
const htmlTable = MagicTablesConverter.convertMarkdownToHTMLTables(response);
console.log(htmlTable);
```
